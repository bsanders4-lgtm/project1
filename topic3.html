     <h1>My Career and future.</h1>

    <h3>
      I want to go into cybersecurity to have a secure way of making money and hopefully be able to finance my hobbies. I additionally
      want to become a voice over actor and/or artist on the side because I think that would be a very fun job.

    <h2>Why I like voice acting, and why cybersecurity?</h2>
    <h3>
      I loved cartoons and tv shows growing up, and alot of times I recognize voices from those cartoons in alot of modern media now. I think it would be fun
      to be that kind of voice for other people, and people told me I had a great voice my entire life. For cybersecurity; its a secure job
      and has more opportunities than just programming and a basic IT job, and its a great market for lots of money.
